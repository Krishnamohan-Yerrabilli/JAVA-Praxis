# JAVA-Praxis

In this repository, I have compiled and solved a range of data structure and algorithm problems using Java. These problems vary in difficulty and cover a range of topics in computer science. If you are interested in working on these problems to improve your skills in Java or to simply practice problem-solving, you can fork this repository and access the code and solutions. By forking the repository, you will create a copy of the repository on your own account, allowing you to make any changes or additions you want without affecting the original repository.
